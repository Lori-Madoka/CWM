# CWM
CLUNC-Window-Manager
supports: X11, devices with at least 160KB of free memory

# Current Status
~~mostly fucntional but not recommended, I need to optimise the calls to the x server to prevent overload and crash~~

mostly funnctional and I would reccomend if you want something tiny that can run in very little ram, fixed the issue with crashing upon applications automatically killing windows
